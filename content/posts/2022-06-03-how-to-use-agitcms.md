Here's a documentation of how to use Agit CMS.

Only thing you need is a static site, powered by whatever "markdown based" static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, Next.js, Gatsby.js and so on.

"markdown based" means you write contents in markdown in your local PC.

Agit CMS is NOT a git based CMS, or API based CMS. It's a desktop app for writing markdown posts. So you need ready-to-run static sites on your local PC.  

In this document I am going to use my blog ( [0xsuk.com](https://0xsuk.com)) powered by Hugo as a static site example.


# Creating new workspace
First, create new workspace.  

Navigate to home, and click "New" button.  

Type site name, and site folder's path.

These cannot be changed afterward unless you modify configuration file directly.
